# Surgical Tool Object Detection System

This project is an object detection system for identifying surgical tools in images and videos using a YOLOv8 model. The model is trained to detect two surgical Tools: tweezers and Needle driver, and to decet a empty hand. the model was pretrained on a small amount of images, and used semi-supervised learning to improve its performance
